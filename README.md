When I started working out I was not sure which exercises worked which muscles
and how different exercises play in to each other. To learn more about this
subject I started reading about the different muscles, what stabilizing and
synergist muscles were and how exercises are performed. After learning more
about the subject I found it hard to plan a workout that did not have overlapping
muscle focus exercises. Because of this, I created a webapp that visualizes the
muscles worked by different exercises.

The Exercise Info tab shows the muscles worked by a single exercise. It also shows
how the exercise is performed, whether the exercise is a compound- or isolation
focussed and how different muscles are worked by the exercise. Hovering over a
muscle on the model shows you the name of the muscle and how it is worked.

The Workout Creator tab allows you to select multiple exercises. The different
exercises show the same information as before and can be hidden and removed if
neccecery.

The muscle model used has been sourced from [Symmetric Strength](https://symmetricstrength.com/).

The different exercises and info such as muscles worked and how to do them have
been scraped from [ExRx](https://exrx.net/) using a custom made python program.

Note that this app uses a large image to show the muscles on the model,
as a consequence of this the app will not work well on mobile. Please use this
app on a laptop or desktop for optimal experience.
